        At The Boda Orda we are passionate about connecting you and your transport need (ride, package delivery or store purchase). We do this by expanding your existing network of riders through technology in a non-invasive and seamless manner. Wherever you happen to be located, you can see the nearest list of riders for your ease of choice. Click on a rider to see their particulars. This way, your interaction starts way before you decide if they are the right fit for your need.
